Aging Index

The indicator based on the ratio of individuals aged 65+ to those aged 0-15

Dependency Ratios:

Youth Dependency Ratio: This is the ratio of individuals aged 0-15 to those aged 16-64. It indicates the burden on the working-age population to support the youth.

Old-Age Dependency Ratio: The ratio of individuals aged 65+ to those aged 16-64. It reflects the pressure on the working-age population to support the elderly.

Total Dependency Ratio: Combines both youth and old-age dependency ratios.

median age estimation

Calculate Total Population: total_population = pop_0_15 + pop_16_64 + pop_65_plus

Find Median Position: median_position = total_population / 2

Determine median age group

if median_position < pop_0_15

                median_age = 15 * (median_position / pop_0_15)

else if median_position < pop_16_64

                offset_in_16_64 = median_position - pop_0_15

                median_age = 16 + 48 * (offset_in_16_64 / pop_16_64)

else ...

                offset_in_65_plus = median_position - (pop_0_15 + pop_16_64)

                median_age = 65 + 15 * (offset_in_65_plus / pop_65_plus)
